Variables
Values that have the ability to be changed or modified via user input or code execution.

String
Literally a string of "characters", including whitespace, to make up a word or phrase that can be a variable.

Functions
Blocks of code that will execute when called upon by using the function's name. Arguments are values that can be passed to the function for use inside of it. Return returns the resulting value from the function's execution.

if Statements
A form of program flow that basically states, if (this), then do (this). Takes an expression and evaluates it to see if it's true, then runs code accordingly. If the expression evaluates to false, the code inside the if statement will be skipped. You can put an else statement to take care of such cases.

Boolean Values
Boolean values are two states -- true and false or 0 and 1. These values usually come from an expression evaluation to determine whether a condition has or hasn't been met.
